# Dalan Weber

Hello, GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Dalan Weber, a student at Brigham Young University-Idaho interested in Software Engineering, specifically game development. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me

As previously mentioned, I have really enjoyed making small games, both console line and with Unity. I typically do this in my free time. As a student, I am working on my software design certificate, so I am learning the different components of designing software and which diagrams are useful in different cases. It has definitely made me a better, more efficient programmer! Designing software beforehand makes it easier to find the optimal solution.

I aim to graduate in July 2025 with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering and a certificate in Software Design. With that, I would like to quickly segue into the workforce in an entry-level position so that I can build my skills and be a valuable asset to the company. After that, I would love to find a more permanent company to work for as a lead or manager, that way I can help/mentor people who are in my current position. I really enjoy helping others, so I think that would be a great fit for me.

## Technologies and Tools

- Proficient in: Python, C++, C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Skills: I am very detail-oriented and strive to find the best solution to any problem I face, not just a quick easy fix. I take pride in my work and love having a plan of action to follow for any given assignment. This keeps me organized and efficient. I am a quick learner, and very open to receiving constructive feedback. I enjoy being a leader and helping those around me with their assignments.
